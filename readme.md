# snippet

vscode custom snippet generator
original idea from https://github.com/djyde/snp

## different
- remove dependencies (ymal and homedir)
- snippet scope from top folder name
- snippet prefix from folder/filename

## how to use
- go build snp.go
- run
- it's will generate snp.code-snippet in vscode

### note on file name
- ...Hello = starter template
- ...Demo = demonstrate how to use (example code)
